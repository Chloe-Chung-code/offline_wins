# User Stories Plan

- [x] **Step 1: Define High-Level Scope**
  - Clarify the core "Premium Calm" aesthetic and functional requirements.
  - Review existing features to ensure nothing is lost in redesign.
  - *Wait for user confirmation on scope.*

- [x] **Step 2: Draft User Stories**
  - Create `aidlc-docs/story-artifacts/redesign_stories.md`.
  - Focus on:
    - **Visual Design**: Themes, animations, typography.
    - **Core Loop**: Timer, tracking, logging.
    - **Retention**: Calendar, streaks, insights.
  - *Wait for user review of stories.*

- [ ] **Step 3: Define Acceptance Criteria**
  - Add specific, testable criteria to each story.
  - Ensure "Premium Calm" is quantifiable (e.g., specific color palettes, animation timings).

- [ ] **Step 4: Risk Assessment**
  - Identify potential risks (e.g., data loss during migration, browser compatibility).
  - Document in `aidlc-docs/requirements/risks.md`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Final Approval**
