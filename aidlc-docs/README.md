# AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)

This repository follows the **AI-DLC** methodology, treating AI as a central collaborator in the development process.

## Key Principles
1.  **Reimagine rather than Retrofit**: Designed for AI speed (hours/days) rather than traditional weeks-long sprints.
2.  **Reverse Conversation**: AI initiates and directs; Humans validate and approve.
3.  **Design at the Core**: Domain Driven Design (DDD) is integral, not an afterthought.

## Workflow & Rituals

### 1. Inception (Planning)
*   **Goal**: Capture intent and decompose into Units.
*   **Ritual**: Mob Elaboration.
*   **Artifacts**:
    *   PRFAQ
    *   User Stories (`aidlc-docs/story-artifacts/`)
    *   Units & Bolts (Plans in `aidlc-docs/plans/`)

### 2. Construction (Building)
*   **Goal**: Transform Units into code.
*   **Ritual**: Mob Construction.
*   **Steps**:
    *   **Domain Design**: Model business logic (`aidlc-docs/design-artifacts/`).
    *   **Logical Design**: Apply NFRs and Architecture.
    *   **Code Generation**: AI writes code & tests.
    *   **Validation**: Human review of AI outputs.

### 3. Operations (Running)
*   **Goal**: Deployment & Observability.
*   **Activities**:
    *   AI monitors telemetry and suggests fixes.
    *   Automated runbook execution upon approval.

## Folder Structure
*   `aidlc-docs/`
    *   `plans/` - Execution plans generated by AI.
    *   `requirements/` - PRFAQs, NFRs.
    *   `story-artifacts/` - User Stories.
    *   `design-artifacts/` - Domain & Logical models.
    *   `prompts.md` - Standard prompts for AI interaction.
